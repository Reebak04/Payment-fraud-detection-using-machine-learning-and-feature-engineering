Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from payment data using machine learning models and feature engineering techniques. Fraud detection is critical for businesses to prevent monetary losses and protect customers from unauthorized activities. The challenge involves dealing with imbalanced data, as fraudulent transactions are a small fraction of the total.

Motivation
Payment fraud detection is a real-world problem that impacts millions of financial transactions daily. We aim to build a reliable machine learning pipeline to identify suspicious transactions, focusing on minimizing false negatives (failing to detect fraud) while maintaining accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized features of transactions, such as time of transaction, amount, and other behavioral and transactional features. A typical dataset will have:

Transaction Amount: Amount involved in the transaction.
Transaction Time: Time of the transaction.
Customer Behavior Features: Frequency of transactions, location, etc.
Class Label: 1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate.

Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Cleaned the data to ensure no missing or inconsistent entries.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converted any categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scaling the Data: Normalized transaction amounts and other continuous variables using standardization techniques like MinMaxScaler.
2. Feature Engineering
Time-Based Features: Extracted features such as the hour, day, and month of the transaction.
Aggregated Features: Created new features based on customer behavior, e.g., number of transactions in the past 24 hours, average transaction amount over a week.
Outlier Detection: Identified and flagged unusually large transactions.
Historical Features: Calculated averages or counts of customer transactions to detect deviations.
3. Model Building
Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated for fraud detection, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks (optional)
4. Model Evaluation
Due to the class imbalance (fraud cases being rare), traditional accuracy was not the primary metric.
Key metrics:
Precision: Focused on reducing false positives.
Recall: Ensured a high detection rate for fraud (minimizing false negatives).
F1 Score: Balanced precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: Evaluated model discrimination ability.
Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were used to balance the dataset.
Results
Best Performing Model: [Insert details of the best model, e.g., Random Forest with an F1 score of X].
The model was able to successfully detect fraudulent transactions with a high recall and acceptable precision.
